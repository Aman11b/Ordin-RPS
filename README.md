# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**! This project is an interactive browser-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes a landing page, a game page where players compete against the computer, and a results page that dynamically updates based on the player's performance.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive UI**: The game is designed to be responsive across devices.
- **Dynamic Background**: The results page features a dynamic background change based on the game outcome.
- **Game Flow**:
  - Choose between "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
  - The computer randomly selects its choice.
  - Scores are updated in real-time.
  - After 5 rounds, the game displays the final result.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── index.html          # Landing page
├── game.html           # Game page
├── result.html         # Result page
├── style.css           # Styles for the game
└── README.md           # This file
```

### Key HTML Files:

- **`index.html`**: The landing page where the player can start the game.
- **`game.html`**: The main game interface where the player makes their choice and sees the current score.
- **`result.html`**: The final page that shows the result of the game, with a dynamic background change based on whether the player won, lost, or tied.

## 🎨 Styling

All the pages are styled with a consistent theme using **CSS Flexbox** for layout control:

- The main background colors, button styles, and hover effects give the game a polished, engaging look.
- On the result page, the background changes dynamically depending on the game outcome, providing instant feedback to the player.

**Example CSS Classes**:

- **`.Welcome-container`**: Used to center the content on the landing page.
- **`.game-container`**: Centers the game elements and buttons on the game page.
- **`.result-container`**: Dynamically adjusts the result page's background and layout.
